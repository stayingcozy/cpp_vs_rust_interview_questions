# C++ vs Rust Interview Questions
Solutions for Elements of Programming Interviews Book written in C++ and Rust. Speed and Memory compared for which is the fastest across algorithms. I'm a big fan of both c++ and rust. This effort is to improve my skills in high performance computing in a fun competitive way. 

clang++ is to be used for C++ compiler to have both rust and c++ use the LLVM compiler. 

Benchmarks inspired by kostya/benchmarks. Speed, memory, and energy consumed will be compared. Docker container of debian will be used to standardize the environment. 

# TODO
- [ ] Add benchmark framework (docker, timing/memory/energy) (great example: [kostya/benchmarks](https://github.com/kostya/benchmarks))
- [ ] Complete Data Structures and Algorithms
- [ ] Complete Domain Specific Problems
- [ ] Complete Honors Class
